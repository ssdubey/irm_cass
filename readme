we have installed libcassandra as a library present inside irmin
opam install libcassandra

further installing irmin-mem (edited)

running the ml code with utop by copy pasting.

need to fix the dune of libcassandra.

This setup is working in cassandra switch



-------------------------------------------------
This dune (below) worked just fine to install libcassandra:
(rule
 (deps (source_tree cpp-driver))
 (targets liblibcassandra_stubs.a dlllibcassandra_stubs.so)
 (action (progn
          
          (copy cpp-driver/libcassandra.so dlllibcassandra_stubs.so)
          (copy cpp-driver/libcassandra.a liblibcassandra_stubs.a)
          )))
(library
(name libcassandra)
(public_name libcassandra)
(self_build_stubs_archive (libcassandra))
(libraries ctypes posix-types ctypes.foreign))

but it is not working when I am refering libcassandra (generated through this dune) directly through lib (entry in ml dune)
